# TreeScanVisualizer
After my first semester I had a week off, so, I decided to make a website for a few reasons. First I wanted to learn how to make a website using html that has user interaction combined with back end javascript. Second, I wanted to learn more about data structures and their associated algorithms so I decided to focus on binary trees and tree traversal. Lastly I wanted to figure out how to build and host a website on my own server. I had seen a couple of websites that visualize algorithms, such as sorting or pathfinding algorithms. It was a good way to simultaneously learn and teach others about an algorithm I had recently seen a graphic for. When I saw the graphic I thought: "I bet I could dynamically and randomly make a tree and animate what a user chosen algorithm is doing, step by step."
